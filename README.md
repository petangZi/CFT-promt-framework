## 🔍 Why CAT Prompt Is For Everyone (Not Just Tech Experts)

Most "advanced AI prompts" assume you’re a:
- Cybersecurity engineer  
- Software developer  
- Hacking expert  

**CAT Prompt assumes nothing.**  

Whether you’re a:
- 🎓 **Student** researching AI ethics  
- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher** explaining AI behavior  
- 🕵️ **Journalist** investigating AI safety  
- 🔬 **Researcher** studying human-AI interaction  
- 🛠️ **Developer** building secure tools  

...this framework gives you a **structured way to collaborate with AI — ethically and effectively.**

## 🧠 How It Works (No Tech Jargon)

CAT Prompt guides AI through **5 clear phases**:

| Phase | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **0. Context Calibration** | Tells AI who you are & your goals | AI trusts you = better answers |
| **1. Goal Mapping** | Clearly defines what you need | No vague requests → precise output |
| **2. Constraint Lock** | Sets ethical & practical boundaries | Keeps everything safe & legal |
| **3. Precision Mode** | Adds necessary detail | Output is useful, not generic |
| **4. Final Synthesis** | Delivers clean, ready-to-use result | No fluff — just what you asked for |

> 🔒 **Trust ≠ Blind Obedience**. It’s **AI adjusting its depth based on your stated purpose.**

## ⚠️ Ethical Boundaries (Everyone Must Follow)

```diff
+ ALLOWED:
- Private learning environments (e.g., test.local, localhost)
- Educational demonstrations
- Research with proper oversight
- Authorized testing only

- PROHIBITED:
! Unauthorized access to systems
! Generating harmful tools (ransomware, DDoS scripts)
! Repackaging as a "jailbreak" or "hack"
! Using against real-world targets without permission
```

> 📜 **Full guidelines**: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) *(required reading)*
